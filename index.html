			<h2>Virtual Textures</h2>
			<h3>2013 - Uni Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">C#, DirectX</div>

			<p>
				I did virtual texturing for my hons project, a system that dynamically loads in the require textures as they are required. I generate random textures on the fly to simulate texture loading.

			<h2>Bike Racer</h2>
			<h3>2013 - Uni Project / Hobby Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">C++, DirectX</div>

			<p>
				This is a hobby / uni project I've been working on. This is a game I've been working on to use on the Oculus Rift, but adapted it to run in stereoscopic 3D for a university assignment.

			<h2>Cupid's Alley</h2>
			<h3>2013 - Hobby Project for Global Game Jam, Team Of Four (Programmer)</h3>
			<div class="tools">C#, Unity3D</div>

			<p>
				So a few of us decided to jump into the Global Game Jam 2013, Our Uni (Abertay) was one of the venues in Scotland. The theme was a heart beat, after a few different ideas we settled on the idea of Cupid going on a bloody rampage, I think this is what happens when you are sleep deprived.

			<h2>Free Form Deformation</h2>
			<h3>2013 - Uni Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">C#, Unity3D</div>

			<p>
				This was fun, we had to create a Free Form Deformation application for our Maths module at Uni. I also got an opportunity to try my extrude rotate and scale skills in Blender 3D
			</p>

			<div class="embedVideo">
			<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61951471" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
				I made this in Unity3D, mostly following the paper by Sederberg and Parry.

		<div class="project">
			<h2>Local Space</h2>
			<h3>2012 - Personal Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">C#, Unity3D</div>

			<p>
				Local Space was a personal project of mine, about making a cyberspace game where you can program the effects of the gun, this was a simple little proof of concept I was working on.
			<p>

		<div class="project">
			<h2>Grav Tech</h2>
			<h3>2012 - Dare To Be Digital, Team Of Five (Programmer/Design)</h3>
			<div class="tools">C#, Unity3D</div>

			<p>
				We were privileged enough to be able to take part in Dare to be Digital 2012. 9 weeks of game development followed by a weekend showcase.
			</p>

			<div class="embedVideo">
			<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/MTblb7fRSSY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
				The game revolves around the idea of Mass manipulation, where you are given a gun that can invert mass, or add mass. You use this as a method to solve puzzles throughout the game. The game was made in Unity3D, all in all it was a great tool to work with.
			</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h2>Shapeshifter</h2>
			<h3>2012 - Uni Group Project, Team Of Seven (Programmer)</h3>
			<div class="tools">C++, Gosu</div>

			<p>
				As part of our 3rd year in Uni, we had todo a group project. This was mainly an exercise in working with other disciplines and clients. A small group of us wanted to create our own game rather than pick from a selection of pre-produced briefs, so we pitched the game idea to the school, and managed to pickup some artists and audio people which we needed otherwise programmer art would have been a feature of our game.

				A wee clip of one of the levels.

			<div class="embedVideo">
			<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/50893418" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
				The main idea is you have no direct control over the player, but instead can morph into different objects that in-turn move you in the environment. During our final pitches Disney saw our game and showed some interest, nothings come of it yet, but it was nice to have somebody outside of the Uni show some interest in the game.

			<h2>Terrain Generation</h2>
			<h3>2012 - Uni Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">C++, DirectX</div>

			<p>
				This was an experiment of making procedural terrains using the faultline method.
			</p>

			<div class="embedVideo">
			<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/35978061" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
				This first attempt was a little mental, the falloff for the fault size was quadratic and started very large. The result was these scary mountainous landscapes.

			<h2>DeadEnd Inc.</h2>
			<h3>2010 - Hobby Project for Ludum Dare, Solo 48 Hours</h3>
			<div class="tools">C++, Gosu</div>

			<p>
				My first time into the LD I was a little worried about it, not really the long hours coding, but could I make a game in 48 hours? Well in the end yes I could (otherwise I wouldn't be writing this and deny I ever took part in it.) and this was entry here.
			</p>

			<div class="embedVideo">
			<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14320140" width="500" height="667" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
				I was using Gosu and C++, C++ maybe not the best choice for this but I was keen to improve my C++ so it was a good in that regard. When I got my prototype up and running I was very revealed.
			</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h2>Sudoku Solver</h2>
			<h3>2010 - Uni Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">C++, Gosu</div>

			<p>
				My first year coursework for the C++ module was to make a game of Sudoku, and optionally a solver. I chose to add the solver it was quite cool really, it uses a stack and brute-forces the answer.
			</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h2>Falling Blocks</h2>
			<h3>2010 - Hobby Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">Ruby, Gosu</div>

			<p>
				I did this for a little bit of fun on the train to and from Uni.
			</p>

		<div class="project">
			<h2>Vector Wars</h2>
			<h3>2008 - Hobby Project</h3>
			<div class="tools">Ruby, Gosu</div>

			<p>
				I love Geometry Wars, its has incredibly simple game play. I really love simple to play hard to master games. This was my first attempt at making a game. My first shot at getting the basics working. Essentially getting the the rotate, scale, translate concepts down pat.
			</p>

			<div class="embedVideo">
			<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/1778975" width="500" height="377" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>
			</div>

			<p>
				This is where I left the game, not quite complete but I was happy enough to move on.
