  <div class="entry-content"><p>So a few of us decided to jump into the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2013</a>, Our Uni (<a href="http://www.abertay.ac.uk">Abertay</a>) was one of the venues in <a href="http://www.scottishgamejam.org/">Scotland</a>. The theme was a <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/news/2013/01/26/ggj13-theme">heart beat</a>, after a few different ideas we settled on the idea of Cupid going on a bloody rampage, I think this is what happens when you are sleep deprived.</p>

<p>This was the result of our hard work.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61953421" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>Something I noted was our &#8216;progress&#8217; was utterly dreadful. I&#8217;ve done a few 48 hour competitions and I&#8217;m generally the first to suggest having constant breaks eat right and sleep lots. This time though all that went out the window, I was having to commute to the venue as I don&#8217;t live in the same city, and Sunday trains are very limited. So I made the decision just to stay at the venue and try and catch some sleep on a couch. Really there was a good atmosphere in the venue which lead to people not sleeping much. Looking back at our progress we could have made the same game even if we went home and had a good long sleep.</p>

<p>I know its nothing &#8216;new&#8217; but in an industry that almost prides itself on &#8216;crunch&#8217; you have to wonder if really there is <a href="http://www.lindsredding.com/2012/03/11/a-overdue-lesson-in-perspective/">any point</a> to it at all.</p>

<p>The model turned out ok, although I think I should have made it less cartoonish to allow the FFD app to apply stylised roof.</p>

<p>I made this in Unity, mostly following <a href="http://tom.cs.byu.edu/~tom/papers/ffd.pdfe">this</a> paper by Sederberg and Parry.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So for my Honors project I&#8217;ve decided on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaTexture#Virtual_texturing" title="Virtual Texture">virtual textures</a>, its a rather scary term (at least to me) but it actually has a lot in common with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory" title="Virtual Memory">virtual memory</a>, and in most cases you can simply swap the word &#8216;memory&#8217; with &#8216;texture&#8217; to get an idea how it works.</p>

<blockquote><p>VTM systems are more flexible and mimic the virtual memory management of the OS:</p><footer><strong>Matthäus G Chajdas et al</strong> <cite>GPU Pro - Virtual Texturing 101</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>That make me feel a little easier about topic. So what we have is an actual texture on a disc which contains all the data that we need but to much to squeeze into the GPU. A texture on the GPU which contains all the data that we currently need. And a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_table" title="Page Table">page table</a> thats lets us find out where the bit of texture is that we are looking for, as it might not be in the same place when we come back to (Hence the virtual bit).</p>

<p>Rage has some nice visualisations you can turn on. On the left its showing the page numbers, and on the right its show the mip levels its rendering at. Green being the lowest, red highest.</p>

<p><img src="/post_images/Honors/rage_vis.jpg"></p>

<p>Well thats all very nice and all, but what does it actually give us? It would allow artists to create completely unique (ie. no repeating textures) texture detail over a very large area, it should also reduce our memory footprint as we are only loading up the data we need when we need it.</p>

<p>With all things though this doesn&#8217;t come free. The first problem is its slow to hit the disc for data. When you are trying to load up data you could get a lot of texture popping. That isn&#8217;t really desirable however it is almost inevitable with this kind of solution, there are some tricks to reduce it but it comes down to the usual game of trying to balance things out. Another problem (on the development side not runtime) is hardware <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_filtering" title="Bilinear filtering">filtering</a>. When the hardware is doing a bilinear filtering it will be using data from its neighboring texels, which in this case could be an entirely different texture.</p>

<p>There is really good video on Virtual textures it over at <a href="http://silverspaceship.com/src/svt/" title="Silver Spaceship">silverspaceship.com</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The topic for my honors project was a hard decision. The two main contenders were <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deferred_shading#Deferred_lighting" title="Deferred Lighting">deferred lighting</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegaTexture#Virtual_texturing" title="Virtual Texturing">virtual texturing</a>, with a visual programming language and VR headsets taking the runners up topics. In the end I chose virtual texturing. Something that Rage used to generate some very petty scenes, and some very interesting texture popping.</p>

<p><img src="/post_images/Honors/rage.jpg" title="'Rage'" ></p>

<p>The basic idea is that you create a massive texture file, in Rages case I believe they could be up to 128,000 x 128,000 pixels then just stream off the hard-drive (or disc) the information you need based on your position in the world.</p>

<blockquote><p>Regardless of how much detail its texture might contain, you cannot display more texels than the screen has pixels.</p><footer><strong>Ben Garney</strong> <cite>Game Programming Gems 7 - Clipmapping</cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>The motivation is an old one, textures in the distance need not have as much detail in them as textures closer to the camera. But the two texture files might take up the same space on the GPU. So if we can stream in the amount of information when we need it we can save our-selfs a lot of memory.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As part of our 3rd year in Uni, we had todo a group project. This was mainly an exercise in working with other disciplines and clients. A small group of us wanted to create our own game rather than pick from a selection of pre-produced briefs, so we pitched the game idea to the school, and managed to pickup some artists and audio people which we needed otherwise programmer art would have been a feature of our game.</p>

<p>A wee clip of one of the levels.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/50893418" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>The main idea is you have no direct control over the player, but instead can morph into different objects that in-turn move you in the environment. During our final pitches Disney saw our game and showed some interest, nothings come of it yet, but it was nice to have somebody outside of the Uni show some interest in the game.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, Dare is over and a serious case of “dare-pression” has kicked in, it was such a fantastic ride, I think most participants are wishing it wasn&#8217;t over.</p>

<p>We got to demo our game at Protoplay (an event held after the contest), I believe somewhere in the region of 9000 people passed through Protoplay over the 3 days. Mental!</p>

<p>The game revolves around the idea of Mass manipulation, where you are given a gun that can invert mass, or add mass. You use this as a method to solve puzzles throughout the game.
The game was made in Unity3D, all in all it was a great tool to work with.
Albert hacked in a two player mode which was seriously alot of fun :)</p>

This was our initial game pitch.</p>
