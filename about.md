My name is Phil Cooper-King, I'm a programmer by day, and by night ... I also code :/ I spend most of my time in C++ and I'm one of these nuts that actually enjoys it. Currently I work for [EsriUK][1] as a Product Engineer, in my spare time I write little games and things of that nature.


However when the wind is right, I head down to the beach and fly kites. Scotland has lovely beaches, and the best weather in the world to keep the crowds away from them :)
