    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So a few of us decided to jump into the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2013</a>, Our Uni (<a href="http://www.abertay.ac.uk">Abertay</a>) was one of the venues in <a href="http://www.scottishgamejam.org/">Scotland</a>. The theme was a <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/news/2013/01/26/ggj13-theme">heart beat</a>, after a few different ideas we settled on the idea of Cupid going on a bloody rampage, I think this is what happens when you are sleep deprived.</p>

<p>This was the result of our hard work.</p>

<p>Something I noted was our 'progress' was utterly dreadful. I've done a few 48 hour competitions and I'm generally the first to suggest having constant breaks eat right and sleep lots. This time though all that went out the window, I was having to commute to the venue as I don't live in the same city, and Sunday trains are very limited. So I made the decision just to stay at the venue and try and catch some sleep on a couch. Really there was a good atmosphere in the venue which lead to people not sleeping much. Looking back at our progress we could have made the same game even if we went home and had a good long sleep.</p>

<p>I know its nothing 'new' but in an industry that almost prides itself on 'crunch' you have to wonder if really there is <a href="http://www.lindsredding.com/2012/03/11/a-overdue-lesson-in-perspective/">any point</a> to it at all.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This was fun, we had to create a 'Free Form Deformation' application for our Maths module at Uni. I also got an opportunity to try my extrude rotate and scale skills in <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender 3D</a></p>

<p>The model turned out ok, although I think I should have made it less cartoonish to allow the FFD app to apply stylised roof.</p>

<p>I made this in Unity, mostly following <a href="http://tom.cs.byu.edu/~tom/papers/ffd.pdfe">this</a> paper by Sederberg and Parry.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, Dare is over and a serious case of “dare-pression” has kicked in, it was such a fantastic ride, I think most participants are wishing it wasn't over.</p>

<p>We got to demo our game at Protoplay (an event held after the contest), I believe somewhere in the region of 9000 people passed through Protoplay over the 3 days. Mental!</p>

<p><img src="/post_images/Dare/dare_stand.jpg" title="'Protoplay'" ></p>

<p>This is the most up to date trailer (but it’s still pretty outta date), the graphics have come on a long way since this.</p>

<p>The game revolves around the idea of Mass manipulation, where you are given a gun that can invert mass, or add mass. You use this as a method to solve puzzles throughout the game.
The game was made in Unity3D, all in all it was a great tool to work with.
Albert hacked in a two player mode which was seriously alot of fun :)</p>
