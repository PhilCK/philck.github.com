    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of our 3rd year in Uni, we had todo a group project. This was mainly an exercise in working with other disciplines and clients. A small group of us wanted to create our own game rather than pick from a selection of pre-produced briefs, so we pitched the game idea to the school, and managed to pickup some artists and audio people which we needed otherwise programmer art would have been a feature of our game.</p>

<p>A wee clip of one of the levels.</p>

<p>The main idea is you have no direct control over the player, but instead can morph into different objects that in-turn move you in the environment. During our final pitches Disney saw our game and showed some interest, nothings come of it yet, but it was nice to have somebody outside of the Uni show some interest in the game.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As part of our group-project in uni, we looked into the possibility of using <a href="http://www.lua.org/" title="Lua">Lua</a> embedded with our framework, which was built upon <a href="http://www.libgosu.org/" title="Gosu">Gosu</a>.
There was a desire to use Lua to speed up iteration speeds, and also to include non-programmer types in the development of the game.
The actual embededing of Lua and <a href="http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html" title="LuaBind">Luabind</a> was relatively easy, the hard part came in the finicky little bits of LuaBind, and the difficulty of of debugging Lua scripts.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/31367803" width="500" height="375" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>We ended up ditching Lua for two reasons, its drain on my time, and the lack of interest (although initially shown) from the non-programmer's in the group to use it.</p>

<p>Iâ€™d like to revisit this some day though.</p>
