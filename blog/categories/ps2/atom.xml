    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I enjoyed this one :) I made a Tempest 2000 clone for my Playstation 2 coursework. The main purpose for this module was really just general software development, but you got to make a game out of it.</p>

<p><img src="/post_images/Coursework/squall.png" title="'Tempest Clone'" ></p>

<p>Looking back there are so many things wrong with this game, the enemies couldn’t jump from there lanes, which was because I had pretty much coded my self into a corner.</p>

<p>In the process of making this game I wrote a little graphics library to deal with rendering, it was pretty much based on old-school OpenGL as that was what we were leaning at the time.</p>

<p>Liquid error: undefined method `Py_IsInitialized' for RubyPython::Python:Module</p>

<p>The library is pretty slow in all honestly but this was due to the matrix transformations killing the PS2’s CPU, part of the courswork spec was not to use the VU, so I wasn’t able to take advantage of the fast math available.</p>
