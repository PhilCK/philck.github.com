    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Well, Dare is over and a serious case of “dare-pression” has kicked in, it was such a fantastic ride, I think most participants are wishing it wasn't over.</p>

<p>We got to demo our game at Protoplay (an event held after the contest), I believe somewhere in the region of 9000 people passed through Protoplay over the 3 days. Mental!</p>

<p>This is the most up to date trailer (but it’s still pretty outta date), the graphics have come on a long way since this.</p>

<p>The game revolves around the idea of Mass manipulation, where you are given a gun that can invert mass, or add mass. You use this as a method to solve puzzles throughout the game.
The game was made in Unity3D, all in all it was a great tool to work with.
Albert hacked in a two player mode which was seriously alot of fun :)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My first time into the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/" title="Ludum Dare">LD</a> I was a little worried about it, not really the long hours coding, but could I make a game in 48 hours? Well in the end yes I could (otherwise I wouldn't be writing this and deny I ever took part in it.) and this was <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&amp;uid=581" title="Ludum Dare 18">entry</a> here.</p>

<h3>Development</h3>

<p>I was using <a href="http://www.libgosu.org/" title="Gosu">Gosu</a> and C++, C++ maybe not the best choice for this but I was keen to improve my C++ so it was a good in that regard.
When I got my prototype up and running I was very revealed.</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/14315698" width="500" height="667" frameborder="0" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen allowFullScreen></iframe>


<p>This was a huge milestone for me, I was able to goto bed happy that I was well on my way.
After a terrible night sleep, dreaming of code and other horrific things, I was able to concentrate on adding the graphics and tightening my code.</p>

<p>I have to admit I had plenty of time to add better audio, but I was tired and my <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pdDhW9Lwepc&amp;feature=related" title="Irn Bru">Irn-Bru</a> was all gone, I just threw some crudely made <a href="http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html" title="SFXR">sfxr</a> sounds into and and called it a day, submitted it, and crawled into bed.</p>

<h3>Reaction</h3>

<p>The morning (after having what could only be described as a coding hangover) I started go get some reactions to the game, they were generally positive, and the negative ones were generally about the difficultly of the game which I accept was mental.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Simple, neat looking, fun and nice humor :). Good work</p><footer><strong>Jhelle</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&amp;uid=581'>LD18 - Entry</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p><blockquote><p>Well that was rather morbid. I think it was the only game about throwing people off skyscrapers, so points for that</p><footer><strong>pekuja</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=preview&amp;uid=581'>LD18 - Entry</a></cite></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>I managed get rank 5th in the <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-18/?action=top&amp;cat=Humor" title="Humor Ranking">humor</a> category amazingly. So job well done.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A group of us managed to get into the final round of the RTW programming contest. We came 6th of about 15 or so groups (last in the final round though).
The final round consisted of a few different tasks, one of them was to make an AI for a car (below). We were “The Programming Effect” (Stupid name I know, but it suited our stupid car).</p>
