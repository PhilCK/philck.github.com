  <p>These are a bunch of projects I’ve worked on professionally and in my spare time.</p>

<h3 id="moshi-monsters">Moshi Monsters</h3>

<p>
	I worked on this as a programmer for <a href="http://www.tag-games.com/">Tag Games.</a>
</p>

<div class="embedVideo">
	<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3s8RA1i9mkw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="glitchspace">Glitchspace</h3>

<p>
	I was a programmer/designer on this when I worked at <a href="http://spacebudgie.com/">Space Budgie.</a> Originally from an early prototype 'LocalSpace' we went on to make this a larger game.
</p>

<div class="embedVideo">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/cajSZ6s5MrQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="virtual-textures">Virtual Textures</h3>

<p>
	I did virtual texturing for my hons project, a system that dynamically loads in the require textures as they are required. I generate random textures on the fly to simulate texture loading.
</p>

<div class="embedVideo">
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/66203380" width="500" height="293" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="bike-racer">Bike Racer</h3>

<p>
	This is a hobby / uni project I've been working on. This is a game I've been working on to use on the Oculus Rift, but adapted it to run in stereoscopic 3D for a university assignment.
</p>

<div class="embedVideo">
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61192504" width="500" height="293" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="cupids-alley">Cupid’s Alley</h3>

<p>
	So a few of us decided to jump into the Global Game Jam 2013, Our Uni (Abertay) was one of the venues in Scotland. The theme was a heart beat, after a few different ideas we settled on the idea of Cupid going on a bloody rampage, I think this is what happens when you are sleep deprived.

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/61953421" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="free-form-deformation">Free Form Deformation</h3>

<p>
	This was fun, we had to create a Free Form Deformation application for our Maths module at Uni. I also got an opportunity to try my extrude rotate and scale skills in Blender 3D
</p>

<p>
	I made this in Unity3D, mostly following the paper by Sederberg and Parry.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="local-space">Local Space</h3>

<p>
	Local Space was a personal project of mine, about making a cyberspace game where you can program the effects of the gun, this was a simple little proof of concept I was working on.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="gravtech">GravTech</h3>

<p>
	We were privileged enough to be able to take part in Dare to be Digital 2012. 9 weeks of game development followed by a weekend showcase.
</p>

<h3 id="shapeshifter">Shapeshifter</h3>

<p>
	As part of our 3rd year in Uni, we had todo a group project. This was mainly an exercise in working with other disciplines and clients. A small group of us wanted to create our own game rather than pick from a selection of pre-produced briefs, so we pitched the game idea to the school, and managed to pickup some artists and audio people which we needed otherwise programmer art would have been a feature of our game.

	A wee clip of one of the levels.

</div>

<h3 id="terrain-generation">Terrain Generation</h3>

<p>
	This was an experiment of making procedural terrains using the faultline method.
</p>

<div class="embedVideo">
<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/35978061" width="500" height="281" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="deadend-inc">DeadEnd Inc</h3>

<p>
	My first time into the LD I was a little worried about it, not really the long hours coding, but could I make a game in 48 hours? Well in the end yes I could (otherwise I wouldn't be writing this and deny I ever took part in it.) and this was entry here.
</p>

<p>
	I was using Gosu and C++, C++ maybe not the best choice for this but I was keen to improve my C++ so it was a good in that regard. When I got my prototype up and running I was very revealed.
</p>

</div>

<h3 id="sudoku-solver">Sudoku Solver</h3>

<p>
	My first year coursework for the C++ module was to make a game of Sudoku, and optionally a solver. I chose to add the solver it was quite cool really, it uses a stack and brute-forces the answer.
</p>

<iframe src="http://player.vimeo.com/video/11747399" width="500" height="750" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</div>

<h3 id="falling-blocks">Falling Blocks</h3>

<p>
	I did this for a little bit of fun on the train to and from Uni.
</p>

<div class="embedVideo">

</div>

<h3 id="vector-wars">Vector Wars</h3>

<p>
	I love Geometry Wars, its has incredibly simple game play. I really love simple to play hard to master games. This was my first attempt at making a game. My first shot at getting the basics working. Essentially getting the the rotate, scale, translate concepts down pat.
