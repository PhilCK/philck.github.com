        <title>New Year, Job, Website</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So my time in the games industry was short, but it was packed full. I helped start a &lt;a href=&quot;http://spacebudgie.com/&quot;&gt;games company&lt;/a&gt;, where I saw my hobby game go into production and published on &lt;a href=&quot;http://store.steampowered.com/app/290060/&quot;&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;. And the last year and a bit I’ve been working at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tag-games.com&quot;&gt;Tag Games&lt;/a&gt;, where one of the projects I got to work on was &lt;a href=&quot;https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/moshi-monsters-village/id635912603?mt=8&quot;&gt;Moshi Monsters&lt;/a&gt; - How cool! However that brings to a close my time in the games industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.cooperking.net/images/moshi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Moshi Monsters Village&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It wasn’t a conscious decision to exit the games industry, but more simply an amazing opportunity presented itself and I couldn’t say no. Tomorrow (5th Jan 2015) I start my new job as a ‘Product Engineer’ at Esri. I’m super excited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So with so much change I thought I’d update my website while I’m at it. It was a blog, then an online portfolio, now its going to be a mix of the two, I still want to work on game related things, I love the tech, the challenges, and making stuff. So I shall push up those details here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The website itself it built using &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll&quot;&gt;Pixyll&lt;/a&gt; theme.&lt;/p&gt;
