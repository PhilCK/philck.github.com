So my time in the games industry was short, but it was packed full. I helped start a [games company][3], where I saw my hobby game go into production and published on [Steam][4]. And the last year and a bit I've been working at [Tag Games][1], where one of the projects I got to work on was [Moshi Monsters][2] - How cool! However that brings to a close my time in the games industry.

It wasn't a conscious decision to exit the games industry, but more simply an amazing opportunity presented itself and I couldn't say no. Tomorrow (5th Jan 2015) I start my new job as a 'Product Engineer' at Esri. I'm super excited.

So with so much change I thought I'd update my website while I'm at it. It was a blog, then an online portfolio, now its going to be a mix of the two, I still want to work on game related things, I love the tech, the challenges, and making stuff. So I shall push up those details here.

The website itself it built using [Jekyll][5] with the [Pixyll][6] theme.
