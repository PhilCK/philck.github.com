<p>A little while ago I started putting up some of my math code onto Github which can be found <a href="https://github.com/PhilCK/caffeine-math">here</a>. Its a small simple math library that I use for my hobby projects (mostly games).</p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What Is It?</h2>

<p>It’s a header only math library, that handles most vector, and matrix math. It has other things in it as well. I’ve been porting it over in small bits as I write tests for those components. Also gives me a chance to add missing functions that should be in a math library but I’ve not had a need for.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-it">How To Use It?</h2>

<p>It’s completely function based. And all functions start with the type name to make things like intellisence easier.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-cpp" data-lang="cpp"><span class="n">vector3</span> <span class="n">my_position</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">vector3_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">vector3</span> <span class="n">my_velocity</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">vector3_init</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="n">vector3</span> <span class="n">my_position</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">vector3_add</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">my_position</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">my_velocity</span><span class="p">);</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Most of it works along those lines.</p>

<h2 id="no-simd">No SIMD</h2>

<p>It’s always been one of those things I’ve meant to add, but usually I find speed up’s elsewhere so I use them. Combined with my projects being small scale. However its something I’d like to add after I’ve finished porting/testing the various components.</p>

<h2 id="what-next">What Next</h2>

<p>I need to finish Matrix support and I have some other basic geometry math I need to add for a project, I’ll add that to the library when I come to that. And hopefully I can get SIMD done stuff at the end of summer.</p>
