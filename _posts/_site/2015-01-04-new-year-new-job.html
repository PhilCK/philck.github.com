<p>So my time in the games industry was short, but it was packed full. I helped start a <a href="http://spacebudgie.com/">games company</a>, where I saw my hobby game go into production and published on <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/290060/">Steam</a>. And the last year I’ve been working at <a href="http://www.tag-games.com">Tag Games</a>, where I got to work on a <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/moshi-monsters-village/id635912603?mt=8">Moshi Monsters</a> title which was cool. However that brings to a close my time in the games industry.</p>

<p>It wasn’t a conscious decision to exit, but more simply an amazing opportunity presented itself and I couldn’t say no. Tomorrow I start my new job as a ‘Product Engineer’ at Esri. I’m super excited.</p>

<p>So with so much change I thought I’d update my website while I’m at it. It was a blog, then an online portfolio, now its going to be a mix of the two, I still want to work on game related things, I love the tech the challenges, and making stuff. So I shall push up those details here.</p>
