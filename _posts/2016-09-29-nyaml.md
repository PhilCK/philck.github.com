Interchange formats are many, JSON, BSON, XML, YAML and it goes on. Alot of these formats are very much at home in certain languages and/or task. YAML is very confortable in Ruby, but to get it into C++ requires a fairly hefty library for what it is. XML parsers are easier to get into C++ but XML lacks the readability of YAML.

I don't need yaml for what I need in C++, I really just need (want?) a better .INI file for config type things.

## NYAML (Not YAML!)

Taking the main syntax style of YAML, but dropping alot of the specs, we can strip yaml right back to a key value tree.

{% highlight yaml %}
window:
  width: 800
  height: 600
  title: window title
  fullscreen: false
{% endhighlight %}

This is nice and readable, no special syntax highlighting required, and we can boil this straight down to a C++ lookup.

{% highlight cpp %}

set_title(node["title"].get_value());

{% endhighlight %}


## Final

I've wrapped this up as a single header library that can be found on github [here](https://github.com/republic-of-almost/nyaml). This isn't meant to be a fully fledge interchange format, its just meant to have a yaml like key/value config file.
